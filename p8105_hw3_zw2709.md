## Problem 1

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns.

Observations are the level of items in orders by user. There are user /
order variables – user ID, order ID, order day, and order hour. There
are also item variables – name, aisle, department, and some numeric
codes.

How many aisles, and which are most items from?

``` r
instacart %>% 
    count(aisle) %>% 
    arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # ... with 124 more rows

Let’s make a plot

``` r
instacart %>% 
    count(aisle) %>% 
    filter(n > 10000) %>% 
    mutate(
        aisle = factor(aisle),
        aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
    ) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

Let’s make a table\!\!

``` r
instacart %>% 
    filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
    group_by(aisle) %>% 
    count(product_name) %>% 
    mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
    filter(rank < 4) %>% 
    arrange(aisle, rank) %>% 
    knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ---: | ---: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |

| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

Apples vs ice cream..

``` r
instacart %>% 
    filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
    group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
    summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
    pivot_wider(
        names_from = order_dow,
        values_from = mean_hour
    )
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 8
    ## # Groups:   product_name [2]
    ##   product_name       `0`   `1`   `2`   `3`   `4`   `5`   `6`
    ##   <chr>            <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Coffee Ice Cream  13.8  14.3  15.4  15.3  15.2  12.3  13.8
    ## 2 Pink Lady Apples  13.4  11.4  11.7  14.2  11.6  12.8  11.9

## Problem 2

### 1\)

First import the data. Then load, tidy and wrangle data.

``` r
data =
  read_csv('./data/accel_data.csv') %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1 : activity_1440,
    names_to = 'activity_minute',
    names_prefix = 'activity_',
    values_to = 'activity_counts'
  ) 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double(),
    ##   day = col_character()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

    ## Warning in FUN(X[[i]], ...): unable to translate '<U+00C5>' to native encoding

    ## Warning in FUN(X[[i]], ...): unable to translate '<U+00E5>' to native encoding

Increase a new variable.

``` r
data_ = mutate(
  data,
  vs = case_when(
    day %in% c('Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday') ~'weekday',
    day %in% c('Saturday', 'Sunday') ~'weekend',
    TRUE ~ ''
  ) 
)
```

Then we encode the data and show them in order

We need to change the variable classes.

``` r
data_classes = 
  data_ %>% 
  mutate(
    activity_minute = as.numeric(activity_minute),
    activity_counts = as.numeric(activity_counts),
    week = as.numeric(week),
    day_id = as.numeric(day_id),
    day = as.character(day),
    vs = as.character(vs)
    
  )
```

Have another ‘day\_df’ variable whose class is integer to denote the
‘day’ character, so that the order based on week and day would be
satisfied.

``` r
day_df = 
  tibble(
    day_number = 1:7,
    day = c('Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday')
  )

data_new = 
  left_join(data_classes, day_df, by = 'day') %>% 
  relocate(week, day, vs) %>% 
  arrange(week, day_number) %>% 
  select(-day_number) 
```

As is shown in ‘data\_new’, there are six variables in total:week, day,
vs, day\_id, activity\_minute, activity\_counts

The variable ‘day’,‘vs’,‘activity\_name’ are characters and the
remaining are numerical measures.

The dataset has 50400 rows, so there are 50400 observations.

### 2\)

Create a table

``` r
data_new %>% 
  group_by(week, day) %>% 
  summarize(sum_activity_counts = sum(activity_counts)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = week, 
    values_from = sum_activity_counts
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'week' (override with `.groups` argument)

| day       |         1 |      2 |      3 |      4 |      5 |
| :-------- | --------: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: |
| Friday    | 480542.62 | 568839 | 467420 | 154049 | 620860 |
| Monday    |  78828.07 | 295431 | 685910 | 409450 | 389080 |
| Saturday  | 376254.00 | 607175 | 382928 |   1440 |   1440 |
| Sunday    | 631105.00 | 422018 | 467052 | 260617 | 138421 |
| Thursday  | 355923.64 | 474048 | 371230 | 340291 | 549658 |
| Tuesday   | 307094.24 | 423245 | 381507 | 319568 | 367824 |
| Wednesday | 340115.01 | 440962 | 468869 | 434460 | 445366 |

The table reflects data about 7 days of one week and the total 5 weeks,
and the data were the total number of the activity counts.

For the first two weeks, the most active activity counts are during
weekends(Sunday for week 1, Saturday for week 2). For the remaing three
weeks, the most active activities counts occur during the weekdays.

For week 4 and week 5, the activity level for Saturday seems to be low
compared with others.

### 3\)

The single-panel plot would have x axis of the 24 hours with the
measurement of time, and would have y axis of the activity counts. Then
we use different colors of lines to represent different days of the
week.

``` r
data_plot = 
  data_new %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = activity_minute, y = activity_counts, color = day)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Activity level",
    x = "time measurement",
    y = "activity counts"
  ) + 
  
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(0,60,120,180,240,300,360,420,480,540,600,660,720,780,840,900,960,1020,1080,1140,1200,1260,1320,1380,1440),
    labels = c("0","1h","2h","3h","4h","5h","6h","7h","8h","9h","10h","11h","12h","13h","14h","15h","16h","17h","18h","19h","20h","21h","22h","23h","24h")
  ) +

  scale_y_continuous(
  
    trans = "sqrt", 
    position = "right"
  ) + 
  geom_line() +
  
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(
    name = 'day of week',
    discrete = TRUE) +
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```

``` r
data_plot
```

From the perspective of 24 hours in a day, the midnight time would have
low level of activity level (midnight to about 6 o’clock). The time
period between 20 p.m. to 22 p.m. at night seem to have higher values of
activity counts and are regarded to be active.

From the weekdays, it seems that the peak activity time of 20 p.m. to 22
p.m. occurs frequently for Friday, meaning the relative active status of
Friday night.
